# savings-goal-tracker
This is an assignment for my Flatiron x SMU AI bootcamp. The goal of this assignment is to complete the following scenario:

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Imagine you are a junior developer working for a financial technology company. Your team is 
tasked with developing a new feature for the companyâ€™s mobile banking app that enables users 
to set and track their savings goals.

Your specific responsibility is to develop the functionality for the savings goal tracking system. 
This system should be able to set new savings goals based on specific users and set dates to achieve
said goals, as well as update the savings progress towards the goals. It should also include a user 
notification when a goal date is approaching and the savings has not been met.
